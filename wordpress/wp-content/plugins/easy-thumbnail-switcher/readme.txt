A simple plugin which adds ability to add/modify/remove featured image just from "All Posts" page on your dashboard.

== Description ==
When you just want to manage the post thumbnail or featured images, you don't have that on quick edit option. You have to go to the edit page, change featured image, save and then go to another post edit page and repeat the process.

Now with this plugin, you can do that directly from your "All Posts" page. When you activate the plugin, a new column called thumbnail is added there. From there, you can add, change or remove featured images of your post.

== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin as zip
2. Go to Plugins > Add new > Upload and upload the zip file. (if you are having problems, unzip to a folder and upload it to the plugins directory of your wp root installation)
3. Click on Activate under "Easy Thumbnail Switcher"

Or,

1. Go to Plugins > Add new from your dashboard
2. Search and install "Easy Thumbnail Switcher"
3. Click on Activate under "Easy Thumbnail Switcher"
